    <body>
        <!-- Rule 1: Save images in the right format                        -->
        <ol>
            <li>Save Images in the Right Format
                <ul>
                    <li>JPEGs: Best when the image is high resolution/contrast</li>
                    <li>PNGs: Best when the image is made up of few flat colors
                        <p>PNGs are also usually the best choice when working with
                            opaque images
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>GIFs: Well...
                        <p>
                            <img src    = "images/kevin.gif"
                                 alt    = "Kevin Malone from The Offic"
                                 title  = "Why Say Lot Word When Few Word Do Trick"
                                 height = "282"
                                 width  = "500"
                            />
                        </p>
                        <p>GIFs are also good for making loading animations/etc.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Rule 2: Save images to the same dimensions used on the site    -->
        <ol>
            <li>Save Images in the Right Dimensions
                <ul>
                    <li>Images dimensions are distorted if the height/width
                        attributes are provided that way
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Rule 3: Save images in an appropriate resolution               -->
        <ol>
            <li>Save Images in the Right Resolution
                <ul>
                    <li>Images should be in a resolution that is sharp enough
                        to obtain the desired appearance while small enough to
                        not require the user to have to download an overly large
                        image file
                    </li>
                    <li>Vector images can be enlarged without losing image quality
                        or creating a large image file to download, however most
                        vector image formats should be converted to a bitmap image
                        format and then uploaded (SVG is an upcoming method for
                        displaying vector images on the web)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
